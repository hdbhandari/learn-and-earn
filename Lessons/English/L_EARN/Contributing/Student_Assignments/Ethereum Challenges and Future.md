- The extent of these challenges are yet too far with what we have in our current finance system, but with time it is going towards it and it is time for us to be alarmed!!

## Resolution in Progress

- Currently it is trying to resolve these challenges, and working with full potential by going to it's next version and with new consensus mechanism and all but the question is.. is it at per the expectations and is it satisfying the current needs? I guess.. No!
